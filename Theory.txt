 - Collaborative Filtering                 : based on the similarity factor between different user
 - Hybrid Model                            : mixture of both



Vectorization:
Vectorization is needed to calculate the similarity score between two two 'tags' which we have created. In this project we are using technique 'BagOfWords' to perform text vectorization in our project


Project Flow :
 
    Data  -->  Preprocessing --> Vectorization --> Model --> Frontend --> Deploy
